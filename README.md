# 🕹️ Pong in C++ by Aziz

> Written from scratch in pure C++. No engines. No frameworks. Just blood, sweat, and pointers.

## ⚡ What is this?

A handcrafted Pong game built using **only**:
- C++
- Win32 API
- Custom rendering logic
- Raw input handling
- No game engine
- No SDL
- Just pain and glory 💪

## 🎮 Features

- ✅ Single player & CPU paddle
- ✅ AI prediction with physics-based bounce simulation
- ✅ Clean fixed timestep physics
- ✅ Minimalist retro vibe
- ✅ 100% custom render system (`StretchDIBits`)
- ✅ Displays real-time FPS + Score

## 🧠 Why this is cool

Because real devs don’t use engines—they **become** the engine.  
This is low-level, pixel-slingin’ C++ gamedev from the ground up.  
Yes, I even predicted ball bounces like some kinda CPU wizard.

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Download pong.exe
2. Run it
